In readme i will provide informations on how to install and run the project.

I will use a makefile to create a local db and restore the .bak file of my database

First create a database and a RESTful API using Entity Framework (I can also create an sql script with the commands to insert the data) - (GET, POST, PUT, ROLES FOR DELETE [SUDO USER, VISITOR], Authantication through JWT tokens, DTOs, Interfaces, Repositories, use Assembly.cs files for versioning maybe)

Then consume the API using a FE framework (Angular propably). Create a simple FE just to show the data for starters. 

Tables: Lessons, Roles (Teacher, Student, SuperUSer), Users (Teachers, Students) IsTeacher 1 or 0, Classes (Day, time, lesson [foreign key]), UserLessons, UserRoles, UserClasses

THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE PROJECT IS TO SHOW THE BACKEND KNOWLEDGE
