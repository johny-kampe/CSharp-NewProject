In README i will provide informations on how to install and run the project.

I will use a makefile to create a local db and restore the .bak file of my database



First create a database and a RESTful API using Entity Framework (I can also create an sql script with the commands to insert the data) - (GET, POST, PUT, ROLES FOR DELETE [SUDO USER, VISITOR], Authantication through JWT tokens, DTOs, Interfaces, Repositories, use Assembly.cs files for versioning maybe)

Then consume the API using a FE framework (Angular propably). Create a simple FE just to show the data for starters. 

Tables: 
	- Role (Id, Name [Teacher, Student, SuperUSer])
	- User (Id, FirstName, LastName, Role[obj]) this table is going to be connected with the Roles table to indicate the role of the user
	- Subject (Id, Name)
	- Group (Id, Subject[obj], List<User>[obj], DayAndTime)
	- UserSubject (UserId, SubjectId)

THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE PROJECT IS TO SHOW THE BACKEND KNOWLEDGE
